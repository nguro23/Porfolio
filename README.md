# My Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio

Hello! I'm a driven and technically-skilled Data Scientist with a passion for leveraging machine learning to create innovative, user-centric solutions. My journey into data science began 17 months ago with an ambitious idea for a personal project, which inspired me to enroll in the intensive Data Science program at **Moringa School**.

This portfolio showcases my capstone project, my ongoing personal projects, and the foundational skills I acquired through my rigorous training. I am eager to apply my knowledge to real-world challenges and collaborate on impactful projects.

## Projects

Here are the highlights of my project work.

### 1. Capstone Project: Personalized Virtual Fashion Recommendation System

This project was the culmination of my studies at Moringa School, combining my passion for fashion and technology to solve the problem of decision fatigue in online shopping.

*   **The Vision:** To fill the gap for personalized guidance in fashion, I developed a system that delivers tailored recommendations, boosting user confidence and creating an enjoyable shopping journey.
*   **How It Works:** The application allows a user to upload an image of a fashion item. Using advanced image classification models, the system instantly recommends similar pieces from a curated dataset of leading fashion brands like Vivo Fashion Group, Ikojn, and El-Alfrique.
*   **Key Technologies:** Python, VGG16, ResNet, CNN, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Streamlit.
*   **Outcome:** A fully functional and deployed web application that provides real-time fashion recommendations, showcasing an end-to-end machine learning project from concept to deployment.

### 2. Personal Project (Work in Progress): 3D Virtual Wardrobe Assistant

This is the original, ambitious project that sparked my machine learning journey. The goal is to move beyond recommendations and create a fully interactive virtual closet experience.

*   **Concept:** The system will recognize a user's clothing from an image, create a 3D model of that garment, and allow the user to visualize and style outfits from their own closet on a personalized avatar.
*   **Objective:** To solve the daily challenge of "what to wear" by providing a seamless, digital experience of one's own wardrobe. This project is highly ML-intensive.
*   **Learnings & Technologies Explored:** This project has been a fantastic learning ground for more advanced and interdisciplinary skills, including:
    *   **Cloud Computing:** Hands-on interaction with Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and AWS.
    *   **3D Software:** Exploring asset creation and modeling with Clo3D, Daz3D, Blender, and FaceGen.
    *   **Big Data:** Working with very large image datasets to train recognition models.
*   **Status:** A lot of the foundational groundwork was laid out prior to and during my course. I am now actively balancing the continuation of this project with my studies, applying new skills as I learn them.
